<h2><strong>Learn about my journey...</strong></h2>

<p>The 2019 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge was the BEST THING EVER! My name is cms19 and I’m new to the world of cybersecurity. You see I was [re]born Oct.19th, 2019 and have been roaming the cybersecurity realm building my skills and increasing my knowledge every day since. So when I heard for the first time, through the WiCyS grapevine, that the Holiday Hack season was upon us I quickly made the trip to the North Pole to investigate.<br>

At Elf University the lessons were numerous and the knowledge vast. I had the greatest time building my cybersecurity skills and encountering so many new technologies. Along the way I met the all knowing “Gooru”—better known as “Google”—and invited him along my journey. I skillfully deciphered Gooru’s advice and completed several tasks before my journey’s pause.<br>
My valiant attempts were transcribed and my efforts recognized with the nicest of words by the Pole’s very own mayor, Director Ed Skoudis. My time at the Pole was awesome and I sure hope you can join me next winter in the land of SANS where I plan to conquer all the challenges I may encounter.<br>
I share my write up and Ed’s kind words with you as encouragement that you too can encounter success if you open your mind and seek to understand the wonders of the cyber realm.<br></p>
