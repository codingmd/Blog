# Workshop Project

I created this project using the skills learned from the WWCode "Build Your Personal Website And Blog With GitHub Pages and Jekyll" workshop. I reused the framework and css files from the workshop github page https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/github-pages-workshop and went to town on the html to create a blog. For the first article I featured my 2019 SANS Holiday Hack adventure. See the blog online here https://codingmd.github.io/Blog/

Check out the original site created during the workshop here https://codingmd.github.io/github-pages-workshop/

HUGE thanks to Suze Shardlow for putting together the best diy workshop ever!
