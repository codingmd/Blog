# Workshop Project

<h2>About This Blog...</h2>

<p>I created this Blog Project using the skills I learned at the January 2020 WWCode workshop, "Build Your Personal Website And Blog With GitHub Pages and Jekyll". I reused the framework and css files from the workshop github page, recreated the syntax steps, and went to town on the html and content to create what you see on this site. For the first article I featured my 2019 SANS Holiday Hack write up and included a fun story on the home page giving an introduction to the exploits of young cms19&mdash;the character name I chose for my SANS avatar (see below). <strong>HUGE Thanks to Suze Shardlow for putting together the best diy workshop ever!</strong></p>

<h2>About The Workshop...</h2>

<p> Suze Shardlow made it super easy for us to learn by providing the framework, placeholder content, and stock photos needed to get started. Her attention to detail and step-by-step guide made it so that those in attendance could have extra time to grasp the process and structure without getting stuck on language syntax. Plus we walked out with a really nice finished product at the end which featured the capabilities of Ruby, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages.</p>

<h2>About The Result...</h2>
<p>In just a couple hours I upgraded my skills and triggered a chain reaction that brought you here today, and me a step closer to becoming a cybersecurity professional.
