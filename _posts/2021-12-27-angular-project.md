<p>My next big project started with a small, uninformed, somewhat courageous leap turned adventure into the land of Angular. In search of another project to build my skills and expand my horizon I tackled a long overdue task of updating my portfolio website but with a twist...completely rewrite it in a new language.</p>
<p>Working solely one day a week at most for 3 hours or less while attending (or hosting) a coding project group meetup, I was able to learn Angular, love Angular, despise Angular, seek out assistance from my Angular network, and accomplish my grand task of updating my website from basic HTML into a more modern representation of my skills and visualization of my abilities. The journey (with all its ups and downs) took just over 4 and 1/2 months, including breaks taken for other activities like preparing a lightning talk, holidays, and non-coding activities.</p>
<p>Through this conversion website project I was able to learn standard Angular component-based framework and routing techniques as well as create and implement a design that is focused on scalability which also incorporated the same libraries and techniques used in the original design but with the required updates and variation based on Angular compatibility need.</p>
<p>The result was a solid Angular foundation&mdash;knowledge of basic syntax, structure, and components of Angular&mdash;as well as expertise in the nuances of integration of common packages, libraries, and APIs within the Angular framework...and an awesome addition to my portfolio. I can't wait to see what coding adventure awaits next.</p>
